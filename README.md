## 📘 About

### **Description and Purpose**

The **Cognitive Game Dashboard** is a web app that helps users sharpen their mental agility through fun, bite-sized cognitive games.  
Players can test and improve their memory, attention, and problem-solving skills while tracking progress through charts and performance insights.

The app gamifies brain training — turning cognitive growth into a daily habit.  
Users can monitor their scores, streaks, and performance trends over time using a clean, data-driven dashboard.

## 💡 Inspiration

We wanted to create something that encourages self-improvement in a fun, interactive way — similar to how fitness apps track physical progress, but for the **mind**.  
By combining psychology-inspired mini games with visual analytics, our goal is to make mental training feel rewarding and measurable.
