## Reflection

### 1. What went well during this unit?

We planned out our project more in-depth, such as details about which columns in the database were superfluous and what we're going to use for authentication (Passport.js).

### 2. What were some challenges your group faced in this unit?

A challenge we faced was deciding the long-term maintenance for our project. In the end we concluded that letting the Render database and web service expire after we take a demo video would be the best to prevent incurring costs while retaining some sort of window into the working product.

### 3. What additional support will you need in upcoming units as you continue to work on your final project?

We'll just need general support about questions we might have, such as related to project requirements, etc.
