## Reflection

### 1. What went well during this unit?

We were able to pick up the pace in working towards our goals more than in previous weeks because our plan solidifed.

### 2. What were some challenges your group faced in this unit?

We faced some challenges with finding enough time to work on the project. It turned out that a lot of us were busy over this past week, so that challenged our ability to work as much on the project as we originally hoped.

### 3. What were some of the highlights or achievements that you are most proud of in this project?

We are most proud of our backend and frontend. The backend, while the simpler part of the project, manages multiple tables and routes as well as authentication. Our frontend is inviting and stylish, and that is where we spent most of our time because that is where our games reside.

### 4. Reflecting on your web development journey so far, how have you grown since the beginning of the course?

We have grown in the sense of not only having more knowledge but also more skills. For instance, while we know how to do backend routes and authentication now, we also learned skills such as teamwork and project management, especially nailing a GitHub workflow that we didn't know how to implement during our solo projects at the beginning of the course. 

### 5. Looking ahead, what are your goals related to web development, and what steps do you plan to take to achieve them?

Our goals include getting an internship or job as a frontend, backend, or full-stack engineer. We plan to continue on this project or create more passion projects to hone in our skills and strengthen our portfolio to secure an internship or job.
