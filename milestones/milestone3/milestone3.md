## Reflection

### 1. What went well during this unit?

We were able to (nearly) complete one game (License Plate) in its functionality (playing, score-keeping, and saving to the database). It was our first game for the site, so subsequent ones should be easier to implement.  

### 2. What were some challenges your group faced in this unit?

One challenge was deciding how the License Plate game would work. In the end, we decided to keep it simple, adding just the minimum mechanics needed to play the game and generate stats.

### Did you finish all of your tasks in your sprint plan for this week? If you did not finish all of the planned tasks, how would you prioritize the remaining tasks on your list?

We planned to have more of the games and the dashboard under development, but so far they haven't been started. We will prioritize the dashboard first because that is a key feature, and having multiple games is simply an extra.

### Which features and user stories would you consider “at risk”? How will you change your plan if those items remain “at risk”?

Perhaps the other games (apart from the License Plate one) may be "at risk" while we focus on the core features of the app. The games can be expanded later, so there is a chance that they might not be made by the project's deadline. We will change our plan if they remain "at risk" by prioritizing away from them for now and seeing if we have time later to implement them.

### 5. What additional support will you need in upcoming units as you continue to work on your final project?

We will just need general support with project directions and requirements as needed.
